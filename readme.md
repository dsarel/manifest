About
---------------

Assuming that CyanogenMod is the biggest project we see in Android, we'll start making it better and cleaner starting on CM12.1. Our main focus is to make Android something different, something powerful, beautiful and stable.
For a better beginning you should start to get familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/developing.html).

Learning
---------------

As stated, we're a project and a project doesn't only is made by experienced developers but also is made of people who would like to learn and follow our concept.
We have a separetly repository with most or everything you should know to start developing for Android. Check it out.

OBS: We recently have rebased and our guide will take a while to be ready again.
